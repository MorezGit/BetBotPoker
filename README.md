# BetBotPoker 🎰🃏

🔨 **Work in progress**: I’m developing a Texas Hold’em Poker game using Python. Currently, the core mechanics and bot logic are almost finished (about 80%). The remaining part is the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, which I’m working on to make the game more engaging and user-friendly. **Expect an exciting release soon!** 🎮
